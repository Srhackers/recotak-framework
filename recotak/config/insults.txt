What the hell are you talking about?
Maybe Bruce Schneier is able to decrypt your language.
Nope
What?
I can't hear you!
Erm...wait...what?"
I hope you don't screw like you type!
No.
Fool!
Icebreaker, he is the shit.
Ask the the sys admin, not me.
Get yourself a coffee. I will think about it.
This is the END for you, you gutter-crawling cur!
My handkerchief will wipe up your blood!
People fall at my feet when they see me coming.
I once owned a dog that was smarter then you.
You type like a dairy farmer.
You're no match for my brains, you poor fool.
There are no words for how disgusting you are.
I've spoken with apes more polite then you.
I've got a long, sharp lesson for you you to learn today.
Only once have I met such a coward!
I will milk every drop of blood from your body!
Every word you say to me is stupid.
There are no clever moves that can help you now.
Now I know what filth and stupidity really are.
I usually see people like you passed-out on tavern floors.
The basic molecular structure of your little brain is still vastly compromised.
Forget it, little buddy.
The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.
You’re the ugliest monster ever created.
When your father first saw you, he must have been mortified.
Heaven preseve me! You look like something that’s died!
Nothing can stop me from blowing you away.
Never before have I faced someone so sissified.
Your mother wears a toupee.
